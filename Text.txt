In twilight's embrace, whispers float on air, A symphony of words, tender and rare.
The sun-kissed meadows, alive with delight,A canvas painted with colors so bright.
Where dreams take flight, on wings of desire,Through mystical realms, where passions inspire.
A river's caress, its gentle embrace,Reflecting the stars in tranquil grace.
